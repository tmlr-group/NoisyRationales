## Abstract
This paper investigates an under-explored challenge in large language models (LLMs): chain-of-thought prompting with noisy rationales, which include irrelevant or inaccurate reasoning thoughts within examples used for in-context learning. We construct NoRa dataset that is tailored to evaluate the robustness of reasoning in the presence of noisy rationales. Our findings on NoRa dataset reveal a prevalent vulnerability to such noise among current LLMs, with existing robust methods like self-correction and self-consistency showing limited efficacy. Notably, compared to prompting with clean rationales, GPT-3.5 drops by 1.4%-19.8% in accuracy with irrelevant thoughts and more drastically by 2.2%-40.4% with inaccurate thoughts. 

Addressing this challenge necessitates external supervision that should be accessible in practice. Here, we propose the method of contrastive denoising with noisy chain-of-thought (CD-CoT). It enhances LLMsâ€™ denoising-reasoning capabilities by contrasting noisy rationales with only one clean rationale, which can be the minimal requirement for denoising-purpose prompting. This method follows a principle of exploration and exploitation: (1) rephrasing and selecting rationales in the input space to achieve explicit denoising and (2) exploring diverse reasoning paths and voting on answers in the output space. Empirically, CD-CoT demonstrates an average improvement of 17.8% in accuracy over the base model and shows significantly stronger denoising capabilities than baseline methods.

<!-- Assistant: In base-9, the digits are \"012345678\". We have 6 + 7 = 13 in base-10. Since we're in base-9, that exceeds the maximum value of 8 for a single digit. 13 mod 9 = 4, so the digit is 4 and the carry is 1. We have 8 + 5 + 1 = 14 in base 10. 14 mod 9 = 5, so the digit is 5 and the carry is 1. A leading digit is 1. So the answer is 154. Answer:\\box{154}

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Choose one of the following installation commands based on your OpenAI API version:

``` bash
## Use new openai API:
pip install openai requests pandas nltk pyyaml scikit-learn tiktoken python-dotenv

## Use old openai API:
pip install openai==0.28 requests pandas nltk pyyaml scikit-learn tiktoken python-dotenv
```

### 2. Configure OpenAI API

You can set up your OpenAI API credentials using either environment variables or a configuration file:

#### Option A: Using Environment Variables

``` bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]
# if you have mutiple API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY=[key1]:[key2]:[key3]...
# if you required specific API base
export OPENAI_API_BASE=[YOUR_API_BASE_HERE]
```
**or** create a .env file in the project path:

#### Option B: Using Configuration File

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

``` txt
OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]
# if you have mutiple keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=[key1]:[key2]:[key3]...
# if you required specific api base
OPENAI_API_BASE=[YOUR_API_BASE_HERE]
```

<!-- If you would like to run `NoRa` with Vicuna, Llama, and Falcon locally, modify `config.py` with the proper path of these three models. -->

## Run experiments

**NoRa** supports three task categories with corresponding subtasks:

- **Math**: base-9, base-11
- **Symbolic**: equal, longer  
- **Commonsense**: (no subtasks)

### Running Options

#### Option 1: Using Config File (Recommended)

Configure experiment settings in `config.yml` and run:

``` bash
python noise_test.py
```

#### Option 2: Command Line Arguments (for quick start)

``` bash
